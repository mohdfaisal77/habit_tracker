Title: As a user, I want to log in using my username and password so that I can access my account and track my habits.

Priority: High

Note: The user is able to register; however, due to security constraints, the credentials are not saved in the browser cache but are removed once the user logs out. Therefore, the user is unable to log in with their own credentials. The only way to log in is with the default username and password.
